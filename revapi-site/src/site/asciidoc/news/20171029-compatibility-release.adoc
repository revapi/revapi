== New Releases Restoring Compatibility

Revapi has started to use Java 9 for building while maintaining compatibility with Java 8 using the Animal Sniffer Maven
plugin. This has proven to be problematic and the link:20171015-releases.html[last] releases could not be used with
Java 8. This should be now fixed and compatibility with Java 8 restored.

The following were released:

* Revapi API 0.8.4
* Revapi Basic Features 0.6.3
* Revapi Ant Task 0.6.3
* Revapi Java SPI 0.14.0
* Revapi Java Extension 0.14.3
* Revapi Text Reporter 0.8.2
* Revapi Standalone 0.6.4
* Revapi Maven Plugin 0.9.4

In addition to the above fix, a new artifact is now released `revapi-java-test-support` starting at version `0.1.0`.
This artifact is supposed to help custom extensions with testing by providing simple utilities to build, compile and
inspect custom jar files.
