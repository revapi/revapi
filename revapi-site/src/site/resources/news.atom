        Shortly after releasing version 0.15.0, there is a new `revapi-java` extension release that fixes a regression which
        caused inherited methods to seemingly break API in classes that were present in excluded archives (wow, a mouthful).

        In quick succession to the new release of revapi-java I also released a new bugfix version of
        revapi-maven-plugin. The new version 0.9.5 fixes the problem with the resolution of dependencies when LATEST is
        used as the (old or new) version of the artifact to check.

        It was discovered that the analysis may fail if it encounters classes that are missing from the dependency graph
        in certain situations. This should now be fixed and all users are encouraged to upgrade to using
        revapi-java-0.14.4 if possible.

        Revapi has started to use Java 9 for building while maintaining compatibility with Java 8 using the Animal Sniffer Maven
        plugin. This has proven to be problematic and the last releases could not be used with
        Java 8. This should be now fixed and compatibility with Java 8 restored.
